---

### 1. Our Goal

The main objective is to figure out which of the two mobile checkout designs—the "old" one or the "new" one—is more effective at helping your customers complete their purchases. Our recommendation will be based on solid data from your users' interactions.

### 2. Our Approach: A Three-Step Plan

To get you a clear and confident answer, we'll follow a simple, three-step analysis plan.

**Step 1: The "Big Picture" Comparison**

First, we'll look at the overall performance of both designs. Think of this as a head-to-head comparison. We'll answer the fundamental question: "Overall, did the new design lead to more successful purchases than the old one?" This gives us a high-level understanding of which version is the front-runner.

**Step 2: Understanding Different User Groups**

Next, we'll dig a little deeper to see if the designs performed differently for different groups of users. For example, it's possible that iPhone users behaved differently than Android users. By checking these segments, we can be sure that the winning design works well for all your major customer groups, not just one.

**Step 3: Checking for Consistent Performance**

Finally, we'll look at the performance of each design on a day-by-day basis. This is a crucial step to ensure that the results aren't just a fluke or a one-time event. We want to see a stable and consistent trend, which will give us confidence that the winning design will continue to perform well in the future.

### 3. What You Will Receive

At the end of this analysis, you will get:

1.  **A Clear Recommendation:** A straightforward answer on which checkout design you should move forward with.
2.  **A Simple Summary Report:** A brief, easy-to-read summary of our findings, explaining *why* we are making our recommendation.
3.  **A Visual Chart:** A clean and simple line chart that visually shows the performance of both designs over time, making the results easy to understand at a glance.

Our goal is to provide you with a clear, data-driven path forward so you can make the best decision for your business.

We are ready to begin as soon as you give us the green light.
